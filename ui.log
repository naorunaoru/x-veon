/Users/naoru/projects/xtrans-demosaic/ui.py:93: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
  fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))
